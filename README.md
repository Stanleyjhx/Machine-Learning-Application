| [project_1](https://github.com/Stanleyjhx/Machine-Learning-Application/tree/master/Project_1) | Implement KNN and Decision Tree from scratch. The datasets trained  and tested are [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) and [Hepatitis](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Hepatitis). Here is our [report1 (pdf)](https://github.com/Stanleyjhx/Machine-Learning-Application/blob/master/Project_1/Report_P1.pdf). |
| [project_2](https://github.com/Stanleyjhx/Machine-Learning-Application/tree/master/Project_2) | Implement Naive Bayes with K-fold cross validation. The datasets trained and tested are [20 News Group](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) and [IMDB Review](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews). Here is our [report2 (pdf)](https://github.com/Stanleyjhx/Machine-Learning-Application/blob/master/Project_2/Report_P2.pdf). |
| [project_3](https://github.com/Stanleyjhx/Machine-Learning-Application/tree/master/Project_3) | Implement Multilayer Perceptron from scratch. The datasets trained and tested is [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Here is our [report3 (pdf)](https://github.com/Stanleyjhx/Machine-Learning-Application/blob/master/Project_3/Report_P3.pdf) |
